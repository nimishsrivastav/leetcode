##### ALGORITHM #####
# 1. Count frequency of each character.
# 2. Check feasibility: If any character occurs more than (n + 1) // 2 times, return "".
# 3. Sort characters by frequency.
# 4. Fill the result array:
#     - Place the most frequent character at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
#     - When even indices run out, fill odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
# 5. Return the joined array as a string.
