# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)

##### ALGORITHM #####
# 1. Use a dictionary where each key maps to a list of (timestamp, value) tuples
# 2. Set Operation:
#     - Append (timestamp, value) to the list
#     - Keep list sorted by timestamp (insert in correct position or sort periodically)
# 3. Get Operation:
#     - If key doesn't exist, return empty string
#     - Use binary search to find the rightmost timestamp â‰¤ query timestamp
#     - Return the corresponding value, or empty string if no valid timestamp found

##### TIME/SPACE COMPLEXITIES #####
# 1. Time Complexity:
#     - For set function, O(1) - since timestamps are strictly increasing, we can simply append to the list
#     - For get function, O(nlogn) - binary search on the list of timestamps for the given key, where n is the number of values stored for that key
# 2. Space Complexity:
#     - O(M), where M is the total number of set operations performed
#     - In worst case, if we have K unique keys and each key has N values, O(K x N) = O(M)
