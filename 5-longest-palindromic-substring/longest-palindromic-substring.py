##### ALGORITHM #####
# Expand Around Center (or two pointer technique)
# 1. For each character in the string, consider it as the center of a palindrome (odd length).
# 2. Also, consider the space between each pair of characters as the center (even length).
# 3. Expand outward from the center as long as the substring is a palindrome.
# 4. Keep track of the longest palindrome found during this process.
# 5. Return the longest palindromic substring.
#####################

# Time Complexity: O(nÂ²); For each center (2n-1 centers), we expand outwards up to O(n) in the worst case.
# Space Complexity: O(1); Only a few variables for pointers and the result string (not counting output).
